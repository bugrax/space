  - Verdict interface: type definition for verdict return value
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all exports
- Utilities maintain backward compatibility with existing page.tsx code
- Committed changes (commit: 70692a7)

Phase 1 (Setup Component Infrastructure) is now complete! ✓
Ready to proceed with Phase 2 (Extract UI Components)

### 2026-01-05 - Subtask 2.1 Completed
- Created web/src/components/ui/ScoreRing.tsx
- Extracted ScoreRing SVG circular progress indicator component
- Component properties:
  - score: number (0-100) - the score to display
  - size?: number (default: 60) - the ring size in pixels
- Color-coded visualization with score thresholds:
  - >= 75: Green (#00FF88) - Strong/Excellent
  - >= 50: Blue (#00D4FF) - Good/Exploring
  - >= 30: Yellow (#FFB800) - Caution/Warning
  - < 30: Red (#FF4757) - Poor/Skip
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Uses existing CSS module styles (scoreRingContainer, scoreValue)
- Includes "use client" directive for Next.js client-side rendering
- Pure UI component with no business logic dependencies
- Committed changes (commit: b2014cb)

### 2026-01-05 - Subtask 2.2 Completed

- Displays traffic distribution across four sources:
  - Organic: Search engine traffic (green segment)
  - Paid: Paid advertising traffic (blue segment)
  - Social: Social media traffic (purple segment)
  - Direct: Direct traffic (yellow segment)
- Each segment is color-coded and sized proportionally to its percentage
- Handles null case gracefully by displaying "N/A"
- Segments have tooltips showing source name and percentage
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation with usage examples
- Uses existing CSS module styles (trafficBar, trafficSegment, trafficNA, etc.)
- Includes "use client" directive for Next.js client-side rendering
- Imports TrafficData type from @/types/dashboard

  - Organic: Search engine traffic (green dot)
  - Paid: Paid advertising traffic (blue dot)
  - Social: Social media traffic (purple dot)
  - Direct: Direct traffic (yellow dot)
- Color scheme corresponds to TrafficBar component's segments
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation with usage examples
- Uses existing CSS module styles (trafficLegend, legendItem, legendDot, etc.)
- Includes "use client" directive for Next.js client-side rendering
- Pure UI component with no dependencies or props

- Provides centralized export point for all reusable UI components
- Exports all UI components:
  - ScoreRing component and ScoreRingProps type
  - StatCard component and StatCardProps type
  - TrafficBar component and TrafficBarProps type
  - TrafficLegend component
- Enables clean imports via '@/components/ui'
- Added JSDoc documentation explaining the purpose
- Supports TypeScript with proper type exports
- Committed changes (commit: 25a1307)
